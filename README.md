## Data Set
The hardest hit. COVID-19 has had a evere impact on Canadians in terms of unemployment rates, hours worked, and labour force particiaption - those who are employed or seeking employment. 

This data set contains the labour characteristics of Canada's ten provinces from January 2019 to September 2020. The database shows the data on a 4 month basis, to compare how the coronavirus is affecting Canada's labour market. The data is sorted based on the labour types (Employment, Full-time employment, Part-time employment, and Unemployment) and sex (Males and Females).

* Why you selected this data set for this project.
I selected this data set because COVID-19 has caused activity to collpase and unemployment to soar. Many individuals in my community, including myself, have lost their jobs or been reduced to fewers work hours due to this pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered one of the worst jobs crises and there is real danger that the crises will increase poverty, widen inequalities and greatly impact our economy in the years to come.  This data from 2019 and 2020 can help us compare the impact of COVID and how Canada needs to take action to stop the job crisis from turning into a social crisis. Together we must reconstruct a better and more resilient labour market, as it is an essential investmenet in the future and in future generations.
